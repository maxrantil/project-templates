# Session Handoff: Pre-commit Hook Investigation - Critical Bugs Found

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Branch**: feat/enhanced-pre-commit-config
**Issues**: #10 (Phase 2 deployment), #11 (Hook investigation)
**Status**: 🚨 DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED - Critical bugs identified

---

## ✅ Completed Work This Session

### 1. Attempted Phase 2 Deployment to protonvpn-manager
- Created deployment branch: `chore/upgrade-pre-commit-hooks`
- Copied strong version config and validation script
- Ran validation: 88% success rate confirmed
- **Discovered critical issue**: Hook allows bypasses in real commits but blocks in tests

### 2. Investigation Triggered (Following MOTTO: "Do it by the book")
- Created Issue #11: "fix: pre-commit commit-msg hook inconsistent execution"
- Consulted mandatory agents:
  - **security-validator** - Comprehensive security assessment
  - **test-automation-qa** - Root cause analysis and testing methodology
- Rolled back protonvpn-manager deployment
- Applied systematic investigation per CLAUDE.md workflow

### 3. Critical Bugs Identified by Agents

#### 🚨 BUG #1: Parameter Error (Line 210)
**security-validator finding:**
```yaml
# CURRENT (WRONG):
python3 - "$0" << 'PYEOF'

# SHOULD BE:
python3 - "$1" << 'PYEOF'
```
**Impact**: `$0` = script name, `$1` = commit message file. Hook may not receive commit message, causing non-deterministic failures.

**Evidence**:
- Test "Co-authored-by: Claude" → BLOCKED ✅ (worked by chance)
- Test "C0-auth0red-by: C1aude" → PASSED ❌ (should block)

#### 🚨 BUG #2: Normalization Incomplete for Gemini
**test-automation-qa finding:**
```
G3m1n1 bypass:
- Current: 1 → l only
- Result: g3m1n1 → g3mlnl (NOT detected as "gemini")
- Problem: '1' can be 'i' OR 'l' in leetspeak
- Fix: Check both normalizations (1→i and 1→l)
```

**Affected patterns**:
- G3m1n1 → should detect as Gemini ❌
- G3_m_1_n_i → should detect as Gemini ❌

**Current bypass protection**: 85.7% (6/7 blocked)
**Target**: 100%

---

## 🎯 Current Project State

**Tests**: ⚠️ Logic tests pass (88%), but real commits behave differently
**Branch**: feat/enhanced-pre-commit-config (has untracked test files)
**CI/CD**: ❌ BLOCKED - Cannot deploy until bugs fixed
**Working Directory**: Untracked files from investigation (test scripts, bug reports)

### Agent Assessment Results

**security-validator Score: 2.5/5.0**
- Logic: 4.5/5 ✅ (normalization algorithm sound)
- Implementation: 1.5/5 ❌ (critical parameter bug)
- Testing: 2.0/5 ❌ (unit tests only, no integration tests)
- Reliability: 1.0/5 ❌ (non-deterministic behavior)

**Verdict**: "Non-deterministic security control = Critical failure. HALT deployment."

**test-automation-qa Findings**:
- Current testing validates Python logic, NOT git hook behavior
- Real git commits use different execution path (pre-commit framework, caching, file I/O)
- Created comprehensive test suite: `test-commit-msg-hook.sh` (30+ tests)
- Created quick validation: `quick-test-hook.sh` (8 key tests, ~10s)
- Created debugging tool: `debug-normalization.sh` (step-by-step analysis)

## 🚀 Next Session Priorities

**CRITICAL**: Fix both bugs before any deployment

### Immediate Actions (1-2 hours - Option A: Quick Fix)

1. **Fix Bug #1: Parameter error** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Edit .pre-commit-config.yaml line 210
   # Change: python3 - "$0" << 'PYEOF'
   # To:     python3 - "$1" << 'PYEOF'
   ```

2. **Fix Bug #2: Dual normalization** (30 minutes)
   ```python
   # Add in commit-msg hook (lines 220-264)
   def normalize_with_i(text):
       """Normalize with 1→i for Gemini detection."""
       text = text.lower()
       replacements = {'1': 'i', '3': 'e', '4': 'a', '0': 'o', '5': 's', '7': 't'}
       for num, letter in replacements.items():
           text = text.replace(num, letter)
       return re.sub(r'[\s_-]', '', text)

   # Check BOTH normalizations
   normalized_msg = normalize(msg)  # 1→l (existing)
   normalized_msg_alt = normalize_with_i(msg)  # 1→i (new)

   for tool in ai_tools:
       if tool in normalized_msg or tool in normalized_msg_alt:
           # ... attribution check ...
   ```

3. **Validate with new test methodology** (20 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Use agent-provided test scripts
   ./quick-test-hook.sh  # Should show 100% (8/8)
   ./test-commit-msg-hook.sh  # Comprehensive validation
   ```

4. **Verify 100% bypass protection** (10 minutes)
   - All 7 bypass attempts must block
   - G3m1n1 must block (currently fails)
   - Run 10 iterations to confirm determinism

5. **Commit fixes** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
   git add .pre-commit-config.yaml
   git commit -m "fix: resolve parameter bug and Gemini normalization

   - Fix line 210: \$0 → \$1 for commit-msg file path
   - Add dual normalization: check both 1→l and 1→i
   - Achieves 100% bypass protection (7/7 blocked)
   - Fixes non-deterministic behavior

   Closes #11"
   ```

### Follow-up Work (Phase 2 - After fixes validated)
6. Deploy to protonvpn-manager
7. Update Phase 2 issue #10
8. Create PR for feat/enhanced-pre-commit-config
9. Update centralized maxrantil/.github with bug fixes

## 🐛 Bugs to Fix in Next Session

### Bug #1: Parameter Error (CRITICAL)
**File**: .pre-commit-config.yaml
**Line**: 210
**Current**: `python3 - "$0" << 'PYEOF'`
**Fixed**: `python3 - "$1" << 'PYEOF'`
**Impact**: Hook receives wrong file path, causes non-deterministic behavior
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE

### Bug #2: Incomplete Normalization (HIGH)
**File**: .pre-commit-config.yaml
**Lines**: 220-264 (normalize function and usage)
**Problem**: Only checks `1→l`, misses `1→i` (Gemini: G3m1n1)
**Fix**: Check both normalizations (add normalize_with_i function)
**Impact**: 2/7 bypass attempts succeed (G3m1n1, G3_m_1_n_i)
**Priority**: HIGH

---

## 🔄 Validation Strategy for Next Session

**Step 1**: Quick validation (30 seconds)
```bash
./quick-test-hook.sh
# Must show: ✅ 8/8 tests passed (100%)
```

**Step 2**: Comprehensive validation (2 minutes)
```bash
./test-commit-msg-hook.sh
# Must show: All bypass attempts blocked
```

**Step 3**: Determinism check (1 minute)
```bash
# Run same test 10 times
for i in {1..10}; do
  git commit --allow-empty -m "test: G3m1n1" 2>&1 | grep -q "ERROR"
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo "FAIL run $i"; exit 1; fi
done
echo "✅ 100% deterministic"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ quick-test-hook.sh: 8/8 (100%)
- ✅ G3m1n1 blocked consistently
- ✅ G3_m_1_n_i blocked consistently
- ✅ No false positives on valid commits
- ✅ 10/10 determinism test passes

## 🎓 Lessons Learned This Session

1. **Testing methodology matters**: Testing Python logic ≠ testing git hook behavior
2. **Integration tests required**: Unit tests insufficient for security controls
3. **Follow the motto**: "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast" - investigation prevented bad deployment
4. **Agent validation critical**: security-validator and test-automation-qa caught issues manual testing missed
5. **Non-determinism = critical failure**: Security controls must behave consistently

---

**Phase 2**: Deployment (blocked until bugs fixed)
- ⏳ Deploy to protonvpn-manager
- ⏳ Deploy to vm-infra
- ⏳ Deploy to dotfiles
- ⏳ Update maxrantil/.github

---

**Session End Status**: Investigation COMPLETE, bugs identified, fix path clear
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours (deployment attempt, investigation, agent consultation, documentation)
**Outcome**: SUCCESSFUL - Prevented bad deployment, identified root causes, ready for fix
**Next Session**: 1-2 hours to fix bugs and achieve 100% bypass protection

---

## 🚨 Critical Reminders for Next Session

1. **DO NOT deploy** until both bugs fixed and validated at 100%
2. **Use new test scripts** (quick-test-hook.sh) not old ones
3. **Verify determinism** (run tests 10 times)
4. **Update Issue #11** when bugs fixed
5. **Follow Option A** (quick fix) per Doctor Hubert's decision
6. **Session handoff required** after fixes complete
