## üöÄ Next Session Priorities

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ ~~Issue #2 (workflow migration)~~ COMPLETE - Merged to master
2. Review remaining open issues in the repository
3. Choose next issue to tackle based on priority
4. Follow standard workflow: branch ‚Üí implement ‚Üí test ‚Üí agent validation ‚Üí PR ‚Üí merge

**Roadmap Context:**
- ‚úÖ Issue #2 COMPLETE - 76% code reduction, root-level CI/CD added, all checks passing
- Repository now has full CI/CD enforcement at root level
- Templates have reusable workflows providing automatic updates
- Two other issues remain: template validation enhancement, customization docs
- Future workflow improvements in `.github` repository automatically benefit all projects

## üìù Startup Prompt for Next Session

```
Read CLAUDE.md to understand our workflow, then review open issues and select the next task.

**Immediate priority**: Review remaining issues and choose next implementation (30-45 minutes)
**Context**: Issue #2 successfully completed and merged - achieved 76% code reduction, added root CI/CD with 8 checks, all passing
**Reference docs**: SESSION_HANDOVER.md, CLAUDE.md, remaining GitHub issues
**Ready state**: Clean master branch, all CI checks passing, ready for next issue

**Expected scope**:
1. List and review remaining open GitHub issues
2. Choose next priority issue based on value/complexity
3. Create feature branch and begin implementation
4. Follow TDD workflow with agent validation
5. Complete issue with proper documentation and PR
