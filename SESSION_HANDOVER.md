# Session Handoff: Pre-commit Hook - Discovery & Final Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-29 (UPDATED)
**Branch**: feat/enhanced-pre-commit-config
**Issues**: #11 (FULLY RESOLVED), #10 (deployment paused for validation)
**Status**: ⚠️ CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Previous fix incomplete, now fully resolved

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL DISCOVERY (2025-10-29)

**Post-deployment testing revealed previous claims of "100% bypass protection" were incorrect.**

### What Happened

1. **e58d848** (Oct 28): Claimed to fix bypass protection
   - Fixed parameter passing (bash → python3) ✅
   - Added dual normalization (1→l and 1→i) ✅
   - **Claimed**: "100% bypass protection achieved" ❌ INCORRECT

2. **Deployment Testing** (Oct 29): Discovered bypasses still work
   - `test: G3m1n1` → PASSED (should BLOCK) ❌
   - `test: Claude helped` → PASSED (should BLOCK) ❌

3. **Root Cause Identified**: Attribution context checking was the real bug
   - Previous logic only blocked AI tools when used WITH attribution verbs
   - Standalone mentions like "G3m1n1" had no verbs → passed through
   - Normalization fixes were correct but insufficient

4. **Actual Fixes Applied**:
   - **83ec7bd**: Removed attribution checking, block ANY AI tool mention
   - **e1669e1**: Added zero-width character detection (agent recommendation)
   - **87195fb**: Added Unicode normalization (agent recommendation)

### Agent Validation Results

- **security-validator**: Security score 7.5/10 → 9/10 with fixes
- **test-automation-qa**: Coverage improved, comprehensive testing complete
- **documentation-knowledge-manager**: Documentation updated with discovery

### Key Lesson

**Never claim "100% success" without deployment validation.** The bug was not in normalization (as initially believed) but in the attribution context checking logic. Simplified solution (block all AI mentions) proved more robust than complex verb checking.

## Original Session Notes (Oct 28) - Contains Outdated Claims

**⚠️ WARNING: The following section contains incorrect claims about e58d848 resolving the issue. See discovery section above for accurate information.**

## ✅ Completed Work This Session

### 1. Resolved Critical Pre-commit Hook Bugs

**Issue #11 - CLOSED**: "fix: pre-commit commit-msg hook inconsistent execution"

#### 🚨 BUG #1: Parameter Passing Issue (FIXED)
**Root Cause**: Pre-commit framework wasn't passing commit message filename correctly when using `entry: bash` with inline Python heredoc scripts.

**Solution**: Changed from `entry: bash` to `entry: python3 -c` for both commit-msg hooks:
- Removed bash heredoc syntax (`python3 - "$0" << 'PYEOF'`)
- Changed to direct Python execution (`entry: python3` with `-c` flag)
- This allows pre-commit to pass the filename correctly as `sys.argv[1]`

**Files Modified**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` lines 204, 333

#### 🚨 BUG #2: Incomplete Normalization (FIXED)
**Root Cause**: Only checking `1→l` normalization, missing `1→i` variant used in "Gemini" (G3m1n1).

**Solution**: Added dual normalization:
```python
def normalize_with_i(text):
    """Normalize with 1→i for Gemini detection."""
    text = text.lower()
    replacements = {'1': 'i', '3': 'e', '4': 'a', '0': 'o', '5': 's', '7': 't'}
    for num, letter in replacements.items():
        text = text.replace(num, letter)
    return re.sub(r'[\s_-]', '', text)

# Check BOTH normalizations
if tool in normalized_msg or tool in normalized_msg_alt:
    # ... attribution check ...
```

**Files Modified**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` lines 231-241, 248

### 2. Validation & Testing

**Test Results**:
- ✅ **G3m1n1 bypass**: BLOCKED (was passing before)
- ✅ **G3_m_1_n_i bypass**: BLOCKED
- ✅ **C1aude bypass**: BLOCKED
- ✅ **Clean commits**: PASS
- ✅ **Conventional commit format**: ENFORCED
- ✅ **100% bypass protection** (7/7 patterns blocked)

**Commits**:
- `e58d848` - fix: correct commit-msg hook parameter passing (contains both fixes)
- `45859fc` - test: debug args (debugging commit, can be squashed)
- `044b68b` - docs: update session handoff with investigation findings

## 📊 Files Modified This Session

**Production Changes**:
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Fixed both bugs (entry: python3, dual normalization)

**Test/Debug Files** (untracked, can be cleaned):
```
test-*.txt (various test files)
debug-normalization.sh
.pre-commit-config.yaml.weak-backup
```

**Documentation**:
- `SESSION_HANDOVER.md` (this file - updated with resolution)

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings This Session

1. **Pre-commit parameter passing**: When using `entry: bash` with inline scripts, pre-commit doesn't pass positional arguments correctly through `bash -c`. Using `entry: python3 -c` directly solves this.

2. **Leetspeak ambiguity**: The digit `1` can represent both `l` (lowercase L) and `i` (lowercase I) depending on context:
   - `C1aude` → `Claude` (1→l)
   - `G3m1n1` → `Gemini` (1→i)
   - Solution: Check both normalizations

3. **Testing methodology**: Testing Python logic directly ≠ testing git hook behavior. Always test the full integration (actual git commits) not just the script logic.

4. **Bash heredoc in YAML**: When migrating from bash heredoc to direct Python execution, remove PYEOF markers (they become syntax errors).
